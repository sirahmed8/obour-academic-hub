## 2024-02-27 - Hardcoded Secrets in Config

**Vulnerability:** Found hardcoded Firebase API keys and configuration values serving as "fallbacks" in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
**Learning:** Developers often add hardcoded fallbacks to make local development easier or "just work," but this leaks secrets into source control.
**Prevention:** Always use `process.env` (or equivalent) and ensure the application fails fast or handles missing configuration gracefully (e.g., returning `null` or logging a warning) rather than silently using a hardcoded secret. I implemented a check in `initFirebaseApp` to return `null` if keys are missing.
